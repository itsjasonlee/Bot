        <p style="color:white;"> StarCraft consistently releases new patches to keep the game up to date. But with every update, the game changes and the overall strategy evolves. In order to keep up with every patch, the player needs to consistently play the game and read the patch notes. But most people are busy with other commitments in life and cannot dedicate time to keep themselves updated with the game. In order to solve this, we plan to write a program to help us analyze the various game strategies of professional players. </p>
        <p style="color:white;"> For this project, the AI technique we will be using in our program is a data analysis of API data to evaluate common patterns and actions that we can then correlate to certain outcomes. To store this data, we will integrate multiple tools based on the strengths of each team member. Integration of various tools will be facilitated by using common data formats to recreate common data structures. Data would be loaded and manipulated in universal formats such as CSV. Doing so would have the additional benefit of making final (visual and statistical) presentation easier. </p>
        <p style="color:white;"> The tabs explore various topics such as APM Correlation, Race win by Time and by Map. In each of these categories, the replays from professional players will be analyzed by a data science approach. In these tabs, the data analysis allows us to determine insights about the StarCraft II in regard to the meta and race. In doing so, the derived insights will allow us to create a framework for a machine learning model for future development of a live game win ratio predictor. </p>
